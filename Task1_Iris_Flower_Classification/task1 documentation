# OIBSIP
# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their features. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the famous Iris dataset, which includes three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific tasks.
- `models/`: Saved model files.
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.

## Dataset
- The Iris dataset is sourced from the kaggle
- The dataset includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks (for running and viewing notebook files)

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Model Training
- The machine learning model is trained using scikit-learn's Logistic Regression.

## Evaluation
- Model evaluation is performed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.
- 
## Results
- The trained model achieves an accuracy of 100% on the test set..

## Usage
- Explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data, model training process, and evaluation metrics.

## Acknowledgments
- Special thanks to the creators of the Iris dataset and the scikit-learn library.
