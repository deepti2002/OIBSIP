# Unemployment Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of unemployment data to understand trends and patterns. The dataset includes information such as estimated unemployment rates, employment numbers, and labor participation rates. The analysis aims to provide insights into the impact of events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on unemployment rates.

## Datasets
- `unemployment_in_india.csv`: Dataset containing unemployment data for different regions in India.
- `unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv`: Additional dataset with unemployment information up to November 2020.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `results/`: Folder to store analysis results and visualizations.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific tasks.
- `docs/`: Documentation files.

## Key Steps

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values, duplicate entries, and format inconsistencies.
- Ensure consistency in date formats across datasets.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand the distribution of unemployment rates.
- Explore regional variations in unemployment.
- Analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates.

### Data Visualization
- Create visualizations to represent unemployment trends over time.
- Compare unemployment rates across different regions.

### Statistical Analysis
- Perform statistical tests to identify significant changes in unemployment rates.
- Compare unemployment rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Predictive Modeling (Optional)
- Explore the possibility of building predictive models to forecast future unemployment rates.

## Dependencies
