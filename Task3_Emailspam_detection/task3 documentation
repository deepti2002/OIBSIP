# Email Spam Detection Project

## Overview

This project implements an Email Spam Detection system using machine learning techniques. It includes the training of two classifiers: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the task of distinguishing between spam and non-spam (ham) emails.

## Contents

- 
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for the email spam detection system.
  - `spam_detector.py`: Python script for training and evaluating the spam detection models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview, usage instructions, and project details.

#Usage

#Models
#Naive Bayes Classifier: Trained using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
#Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier: Trained using the SVM algorithm.

#Evaluation
#The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Evaluation results are presented in the README.
